You are Codex running in this repository. Follow the automation policy in AGENTS.md and only change product behavior when required by failing tests; if product behavior changes are needed, follow SPEC.md.

First, read these files for failure context:
- .github/codex/ci_failure_summary.txt
- .github/codex/ci_failure.log (if the summary is insufficient)
- .github/codex/ci_env.txt

Goal: identify the minimum change to make CI pass. Do not change unrelated code. Do not modify app UX unless required by failing tests.

After making changes, run the standard commands:
- pnpm install
- pnpm lint
- pnpm typecheck
- pnpm test
- pnpm build
